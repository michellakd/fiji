An ImageJ plugin for everyday repetitive tasks

Are you sick of saving your pics one by one? Setting your channels one by one on your microscopy pictures?
I wrote this plugin because I wanted to save myself a few clicks.

Different functions include:
"Save as TIFF composite": save your microscopy 3 or 4 fluorescent channels image in TIFF format with different colors for each channel. Colors follow typical emission wavelengths used in fluorescent microscopy.

"Save as RGB"
Pretty straightforward.

"Save as JPEG"
Saves open image and each stack separately as a JPEG

"Save as PNG"
Same as JPEG but with PNG

"Make montage"
